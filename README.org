* Set up

  1. Clone this repo.
  2. Create an account for Mathpix OCR over at [[https://mathpix.com/ocr][Mathpix]].
  3. Insert your Mathpix OCR app id and key in ~auth.el.template~, and save it
     as a new ~auth.el.gpg~ file. ~math2latex~ will then load this file and your
     credentials.
  4. Load the ~math2latex.el~ file

* Usage

  1. Have the formula you want to convert ready on the screen somewhere
  2. In emacs, move the pointer to where the LaTeX formula should go
  3. M-x math2latex
  4. Draw box around the formula you want to convert
  5. LaTeX version of your formula will appear at point

* Next tasks [4/6]

  - [ ] Split functionality in ~math2latex.el~ over multiple functions
  - [ ] Better handle response from Mathpix
    - [ ] Define :complete function separately
    - [ ] Print a message when response says no formula was detected
    - [ ] Print confidence level in case conversion is successful
  - [X] Make demonstrative video
  - [X] Make this into package format
  - [X] Create logo for project
  - [X] Test this on Linux
